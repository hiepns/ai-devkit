## [0.36.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Managed Agent Start** - Added `ai-devkit agent start` to launch named agents in managed tmux sessions with `--type`, `--name`, and `--cwd` options, PID polling, stale session cleanup, and registry tracking (#90).
- **Agent Rename** - Added `ai-devkit agent rename <current-name> <new-name>` to rename live registry entries with validation and conflict handling (#92).

### Changed

- **Agent Registry Synchronization** - Agent discovery now mirrors live Codex and Gemini CLI sessions into the registry so running agents stay available for list/detail/send workflows even when started outside `agent start` (#91).
- **Agent List Project Column** - Updated `ai-devkit agent list` to show the project name instead of the full working directory for a more compact running-agent table.
- **Dev Lifecycle Guidance** - Enhanced the `dev-lifecycle` skill's test-planning and implementation-log guidance.

### Fixed

- **Claude Code Status Detection** - Fixed Claude Code sessions being reported with unknown status by improving session parsing for meaningful conversation entries and interrupted requests.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- **Agent Console** - New `ai-devkit agent console` command that launches a live multi-agent terminal UI (TUI) with an agent list pane, conversation preview, chat input, and status footer for monitoring and interacting with multiple running agents simultaneously (#88).

### Changed

- **ESM Migration** - Converted all packages (`cli`, `agent-manager`, `channel-connector`, `memory`) from CommonJS to ES Modules, migrated the test runner from Jest to Vitest, and upgraded project dependencies (#87).
- **Dev Lifecycle Clarification Contract** - Tightened the clarification requirements in the `dev-lifecycle` skill's `SKILL.md` and updated `new-requirement`, `review-design`, and `review-requirements` references; improved the `check-status.sh` script.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Added `ai-devkit docs init-feature <name>` to initialize date-prefixed feature docs for configured phases using the current local date, with optional `--json` output for agents and scripts.
- Added lint support for date-prefixed feature docs while preserving compatibility with legacy `feature-{name}.md` docs.

### Changed

- Updated lifecycle command templates and the `dev-lifecycle` skill to initialize feature docs through `docs init-feature` and reference latest matching `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-{name}.md` docs.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- `ai-devkit agent session detail` now shows detailed historical session information and conversation history, with `--json`, `--type`, `--full`, `--tail`, and `--verbose` options.
- `ai-devkit channel connect telegram --name <name>` now supports multiple named Telegram channel configurations, including duplicate-token protection and persisted authorized chat IDs.
- `ai-devkit channel start <name> --agent <name> --daemon` can run channel bridges in the background, with bridge process tracking, log paths, status reporting, and `ai-devkit channel stop [name]` support.

### Changed

- `ai-devkit channel list` and `ai-devkit channel status` now show authorization and live bridge state for configured channels.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- `ai-devkit agent send --wait` now supports `--stdin` and piped input, allowing automation scripts to pass prompts without a positional message argument.
- `ai-devkit agent send --wait` now supports `--timeout <milliseconds>` to configure the maximum wait time for an agent response.
- `ai-devkit agent send --wait --json` now emits structured JSON with target metadata, the prompt, captured response messages, elapsed time, and final status.
- Added documentation and FAQ content for automating programmatic agent calls with `agent send --wait`.

### Changed

- Refreshed README, package descriptions, and web documentation copy to better explain AI DevKit workflows, supported agents, memory, channels, and agent-manager usage.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- `ai-devkit agent send` now accepts `--wait` to block until the target agent returns a new assistant response, polling the session transcript and printing the captured output on stdout while keeping status/warning logs on stderr (https://github.com/codeaholicguy/ai-devkit/pull/83).

## [0.30.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- **OpenCode Agent Adapter** - Added `OpenCodeAdapter` to `agent-manager` so `ai-devkit agent` commands can discover, inspect, and control running OpenCode sessions.
- **HTML Artifact in `document-code` Skill** - The `document-code` skill now offers an HTML artifact alongside its markdown output.

### Fixed

- **Claude Code PID-File Live Status** - `agent-manager` now prefers the PID-file live status when resolving Claude Code agent state, improving accuracy of `agent list` output.
- **Claude Code Lossy Project Dir Encoding** - `agent-manager` now matches Claude Code's lossy project directory encoding when resolving session paths, fixing session discovery for paths that Claude Code re-encodes.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- **Non-interactive `init`** - `ai-devkit init` now accepts `-y, --yes` to run without prompts (required for agent/CI contexts where stdin is not a TTY). Without a template, `--yes` requires `-e <env>` and one of `-a`/`-p`, otherwise it exits non-zero with a clear message instead of hanging on a checkbox prompt.
- **`init --overwrite` flag** - When combined with `--yes`, `--overwrite` overwrites existing environments and phase files; the default under `--yes` is to skip them, matching the `install --overwrite` convention.
- **Telegram Markdown Rendering** - `channel-connector`'s Telegram adapter now renders Markdown to Telegram-flavored HTML with an automatic plain-text fallback when Telegram rejects the formatted payload.
- **Channel Polling Diagnostics** - The `channel` command now surfaces polling-loop errors and emits diagnostic logs to help debug long-running channel sessions.

### Changed

- **Dev Lifecycle Bootstrap** - The `dev-lifecycle` skill's prerequisite step now invokes `ai-devkit init -a -e claude --built-in --yes` so agents (e.g., OpenCode in a fresh worktree) cannot block on interactive prompts when `.ai-devkit.json` is missing.
- **Renamed `debug` Skill to `structured-debug`** - The `debug` skill has been renamed to `structured-debug` across the registry, templates, and docs to clarify its purpose.
- **Renamed `capture-knowledge` Skill to `document-code`** - The `capture-knowledge` skill has been renamed to `document-code` across the registry, templates, and docs to better reflect its purpose.
- **Built-in Skills Updated** - Updated the CLI's built-in skill list to reflect the `structured-debug` and `document-code` renames.

### Fixed

- **Resumed Claude Session Matching** - `agent-manager` now matches resumed Claude Code sessions by parsing the `--resume <uuid>` argument, fixing detection of sessions started via `claude --resume`.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- **Agent Sessions Command** - New `ai-devkit agent sessions` command to list historical agent sessions (#79).
- **Security Review Skill** - Added new `security-review` skill for security-focused review workflows.
- **Playwright CLI Skill** - Added Playwright CLI entry to the skills registry.
- **Google Skills Repository** - Added Google skills repository to `registry.json`.

### Changed

- **Strip Claude Code Tag** - `agent-manager` now strips the Claude Code tag from session output.
- **Dev Lifecycle Execute Phase** - Improved the dev-lifecycle skill's execute phase guidance.
- **Branding Updates** - Updated branding across CLI command templates, command files, and skills.

### Fixed

- **AppleScript Escape Utility** - Added an AppleScript escape utility in `agent-manager` to handle quoting safely.
- **Native FS Session Finding** - Switched `agent-manager` session finding to use native `fs` instead of shelling out via `exec`.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **Check Status Path Traversal** - Validated `FEATURE` argument in `check-status.sh` to prevent path traversal (#66).
- **Shell Injection in TerminalFocusManager** - Fixed `execAsync` calls to use array arguments instead of string interpolation, preventing potential shell injection.

### Changed

- **SkillManager Refactor** - Split `SkillManager` into dedicated `SkillIndex` and `SkillRegistry` modules for better separation of concerns.
- **ClaudeCodeAdapter Refactor** - Extracted session parsing logic from `ClaudeCodeAdapter` into a standalone `ClaudeSessionParser` utility.
- **Centralized Error Handling** - Added `withErrorHandler` utility for consistent error handling across CLI commands (`agent`, `channel`, `memory`, `skill`).
- **AgentManager getAdapter** - Added `getAdapter()` method to `AgentManager`, reducing adapter resolution duplication in CLI commands.
- **Standardized Error Types** - Updated all try-catch blocks to use `unknown` error type for type safety.
- **Environment Code Consistency** - Renamed environment code references for consistency across CLI (`init`, `Config`, `EnvironmentSelector`, `TemplateManager`).
- **Code Cleanup** - Removed stray `console.log` statements, cleaned up tests, and added `.editorconfig`.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Gemini CLI Agent Adapter** - Added `GeminiCliAdapter` to the agent manager so `ai-devkit agent list` and `ai-devkit agent detail` can discover and inspect running Gemini CLI sessions, with process detection, session discovery via `projectHash` matching, and content normalization for Gemini's polymorphic message format (#70).
- **Gemini CLI Channel Support** - Added `GeminiCliAdapter` to the `channel` command for Gemini CLI channel operations.

### Fixed

- **Shell Injection Prevention** - Hardened git utility functions against shell injection.
- **Skill Path Validation** - Added validation for skill paths to prevent invalid path traversal in `SkillManager`.

### Changed

- **Removed Redundant Commands** - Cleaned up duplicate command templates (`capture-knowledge`, `debug`, `simplify-implementation`) from both root `commands/` and `packages/cli/templates/commands/`.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **Agent Manager Terminal.app Detection** - Fixed Terminal.app detection in the agent manager.
- **Agent Manager iTerm Sending** - Fixed sending input to agents in iTerm.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- **Flat Config Structure** - Moved `registries` and `skills` to top-level fields in project, global, and template configs. Previously `registries` was nested under `skills` (`skills.registries`); now both `registries` and `skills` sit at the same level for consistency across all config contexts.
- **Template Registries Support** - Init templates can now declare custom `registries` that get saved to the project config during `ai-devkit init --template`.
- **Shared Registry Filter** - Extracted duplicate registry-filtering logic from `ConfigManager` and `GlobalConfigManager` into a shared `filterStringRecord()` helper.
- **Removed Dead Code** - Removed unused `getInstalledSkills()` method, `normalizeSkillsConfig()` method, `SkillsConfig` interface, and `SkillRegistriesConfig` interface.

### Breaking Changes

- The `skills` field in `.ai-devkit.json` is now always a plain array of `{ registry, name }` objects. The previous object format (`{ registries: {...}, installed: [...] }`) is no longer supported.
- The global config (`~/.ai-devkit/.ai-devkit.json`) now uses a top-level `registries` field instead of `skills.registries`.

## [0.23.1] - 2026-04-17

- **Install Update Guard** - Fixed install service updating config when there are no successful installs.
- **Install Skills Update Guard** - Fixed install service including skills in the update object when there are no successful skills.
- **Install Skills Object Format** - Fixed `install` failing when the `skills` field in config is an object with an `installed` array rather than a plain array.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

### Fixed

- **Memory MCP Tool Names** - Renamed MCP tool names from dot-separated (`memory.storeKnowledge`) to underscore-separated (`memory_storeKnowledge`, `memory_updateKnowledge`, `memory_searchKnowledge`) to comply with strict MCP client naming regex `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$`; backward-compat aliases retained for existing users (#59).
- **Skill Add With No Environments** - Fixed `skill add` crashing when no environments are defined in config.
- **Config addSkill Crash** - Fixed `addSkill()` crashing when the `skills` field is an object containing a `registries` key rather than an array.
