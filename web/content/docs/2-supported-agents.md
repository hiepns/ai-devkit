## Environment Setup

### Interactive Multi-Selection

When you run `ai-devkit init`, you can select multiple environments at once:

```bash
ai-devkit init
```

This presents an interactive checklist where you can:
- **Spacebar** — Select or deselect an environment
- **Enter** — Confirm your selections
- Select any combination of the supported environments

### Configuration Storage

Your selections are saved in `.ai-devkit.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "0.21.1",
  "environments": ["cursor", "claude", "github"],
  "phases": ["requirements", "design"],
  "createdAt": "2026-04-04T...",
  "updatedAt": "2026-04-04T..."
}
```

### Adding More Environments Later

Want to add another environment after initial setup? Just run:

```bash
ai-devkit init
```

AI DevKit will:
1. Detect your existing environments
2. Ask before overwriting any existing configurations
3. Add new environments alongside existing ones

### Override Protection

When re-running `ai-devkit init`, you'll see a warning before any existing files are overwritten:

```
Warning: The following environments are already set up: cursor, claude

Do you want to continue?
```
